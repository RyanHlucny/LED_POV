# LED_POV

[NDSU](https://www.ndsu.edu/) Senior Design project: Two foot diameter LED spinning display using persistence-of-vision techniques.

## Documentation

The Documentation for this project is done using [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can navigate around using the headers on the website. Many items are linked together, making for especially easy navigation.

## Software Development

If you are interested in setting up your software development environment similar to how I did in this project, I wrote a 'getting started' page for this. You can find that page at [Software Development](https://github.com/RyanHlucny/LED_POV/blob/main/SD403/Ryan%20Hlucny/Software%20Development/GettingStarted.md)

## Weekly Meetings

Our weekly meetings were where we got a lot of stuff done, and we took a lot of care and effort to document as much of the build process as we could. So please check out [Weekly Meetings](https://github.com/RyanHlucny/LED_POV/blob/main/SD403/Weekly%20Meetings/Weekly_Meetings.md) to see and learn more about this project.
