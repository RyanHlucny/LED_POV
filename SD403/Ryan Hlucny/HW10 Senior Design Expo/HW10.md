# HW10 - Senior Design Expo

### Favorite Project

My favorite project from the Senior Design Expo is the Head Tracker camera on the articulating/rotating platform using an IMU. I liked that it was interactive and it followed the sensor's movements really well. There were a lot of aspects to this project. Including wireless connectivity and a visualizer application. The ESP32 camera was also really cool! I could see uses for this in a deployable military/disaster recovery robot as a way for the operator to be able to clearly see around the robot while remotely controlling it. Very cool!

### Improvement

To improve the presentation, I would probably display a cut-section view of the rotation device to show off the internals and some diagrams to show the overview of the design. I would also like to see some kind of head/helmet mount for the sensor and have it battery powered so it doesn't have to be plugged in.
