### ECE Tools

**Oscilloscope** - Measuring signal timing and signal characteristics. Debugging SPI communication channel between [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html) and custom LED board utilizing [Adafruit DotStar (SK9822) Addressable RGB LEDs](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2343), and I2C Communications to [IMU sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15335).

**Development Environments** - I will be using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Platform.io extension](https://platformio.org/) to develop the embedded code for the [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html) in C++. I am running an [arduino-pico core](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which ports the RP2040 mcu to the Arduino ecosystem, from [earlephilhower](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico). The documentation for arduino-pico can be found [here](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
